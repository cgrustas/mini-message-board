# Mini Message Board

Mini Message Board is a simple web application built with Node.js and Express that allows users to view and post messages. The app features a home page displaying all messages with their author, text message, and timestamp, as well as a form page for submitting new messages. Users can also view individual message details on dedicated pages. Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Skills Demonstrated

Upon completing this project, the following skills have been demonstrated:

- Setting up a basic Express server and understanding the request-response cycle
- Setting up and using EJS as a templating engine to render dynamic views
- Defining GET and POST methods using Express Router
- Creating dynamic pages with route parameters (used for individual message views)
- Using middleware functions, (i.e. `express.urlencoded()`) to parse form data
